            <h2>About Healthy Food</h2>
            <p class="details">Food has been given a very significant place in our lives because it is our primary
                requirement. It
                is
                our basic need because it is the source of mental and physical energy. The food that we eat, not
                only
                affects our body and the efficiency of our mind but directly affects our nature and habits. The
                Knowledge of balanced diet is therefore indispensable to “Good health”.</p>

                    good news is that making yogurt is incredibly easy—as long as you keep your tools clean and don't
                    jiggle the mixture while it's setting, it's almost foolproof.</p>
